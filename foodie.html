	<h1>Atlanta Foodie Blog</h1>
	<p>Favorite Restaurants of Atlanta
Updated August 2015

I get asked all the time, so here is a list of my favorite places in Atlanta. I’ve grouped them into logical sections, then I list some of my favorite attributes of each. Maybe now I can send this list to all those people who email me for suggestions, but never seem to take any of them. Jerks.

These are places I’ve visited in the last year. This isn’t a “best of” list. I don’t care if you know a better pho place or don’t like a particular burger joint. It’s just a blog, I don’t make it up to Buford Highway as often as many people, I have a limited budget, and despite my amazing authoritative presence, I don’t know everything.

Highlighted are my current super favorites.
